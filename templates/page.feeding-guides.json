This can be in the form of whole bones (eg. a chicken neck), or a bone-in ground meat (eg. minced chicken frames). </p>",

It contains sufficient calcium to meet the minimum requirement for adult animals and it’s primarily made from water buffalo, goat, sardines and kangaroo. </p><p>Vital Blend is a stripped back blend, perfect for people who feed a homemade diet around the ratio, 80/10/10 or BARF principles, but still want a safety net for all those fiddly nutritional gaps. This blend contains no calcium or liver, so you need to include these ingredients in your meal prep. But you only need to use half as much, so it’s our budget friendly option. </p>",

The other reason is that not everyone wants to feed fruit and veg, and we really value that flexibility. </p><p>So long as you prepare the main food according to the directions, you will be providing a balanced diet. Any supplementary fruits and vegetables you add won’t negatively impact this, so long as it’s not excessive.  </p>",

Feeding guides are incredibly difficult to create, because dogs and cats can vary so dramatically in their size, metabolism, activity levels and the kind of food they eat. </p><p>To give you a practical example of what we mean, our founder has two adult kelpies who are the same weight, eat the same food and do the same exercise. Pip eats almost twice as much as Tex and never gains weight, but if Tex so much as looks at an extra 50g a day, it goes straight to his waistline. </p><p>We have designed this calculator using a few assumptions that may be resulting in a different outcome to what you expected. It assumes your pet is eating a raw, species-appropriate diet, so the result will be very different for a processed diet. If you feed a cooked diet, our feeding calculator gives you raw weights, before you cook it. And it uses percentage of bodyweight formulas, not calories. </p><p>We have used the upper limit of how many grams per day we would recommend, so it’s quite likely you will actually feed them less. It’s unlikely (but not impossible) that you will need to feed more than we’ve recommended. </p><p>Monitor their weight and hunger levels and adjust the portions accordingly. You may need to feed them less in summer and more in winter. Their metabolism may slow with age or after desexing. Be mindful of whether you are feeding very lean meats or fattier ones, and of how much exercise they’re getting. </p><p>Above all else, our advice is to feed the animal in front of you. No one knows them better than you. Feed your pet the amount of food that keeps them lean, nourished and content. </p>",
